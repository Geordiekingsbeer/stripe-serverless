[build]
  command = "" 
  publish = "netlify/functions"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
```

### Step 2: Implement the Redirects Fix (The Undeniable Solution)

We need to create the **`_redirects`** file and commit it, which is the final, high-priority fix that works when the header configuration fails. This file is processed at the highest level by the Netlify CDN.

You must create a file named **`_redirects`** in the **root** of your **`stripe-serverless`** repository and paste this single line:

```
# CRITICAL FIX: Add CORS headers to all function responses (highest priority)
/.netlify/functions/* / .netlify/functions/:splat 200! Access-Control-Allow-Origin=https://geordiekingsbeer.github.io,Access-Control-Allow-Methods=POST,GET,OPTIONS,Access-Control-Allow-Headers=Content-Type,Authorization
